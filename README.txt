This project is a poker hand evaluator which assigns a numerical score to any poker hand (5 cards).
Given 7 cards, it will find the best possible combination for a poker hand to determine a player's hand using the board.
The main class includes a demo, allowing you to see who has the winning hand between 2 players.
All of the functionality may be found in the Deck class, which utilizes the Card class.
